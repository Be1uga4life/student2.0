Week 5 Summary
Tuesday
We started our day by listening in to a tech talk about the upcoming team teaching project on the first week of October. We then signed up to the team test on Friday as most of the slots on Thursday were already full and also signed up for the team teaching project on the topic on algorithms. We then started our team test prep by completing the scrum board process and the agile team manifesto on Canva and shared it across to our team through iMessages which is our main source of communication. We than shared our codes and our progress with our scrum master and ended our day with a little chit chat with out group members.

Wednesday
On Wednesday we continued with work on the project with us making the different scripts for collaboration and the scripts of the codes as well. We then continued working on making ht erpoject better and also begin to plan on how we shall be recording our videos, in the end we decided to user an application that allowed us to record our faces as well as share the document with the codes etc. We then completed the day by pair sharing what we had done so far.

Thursday
Today was teh day we began our recording for the team test. W took turns and read out the script as well as explained in detail what each of us had done and our contributions to the team test and the group overall. We then began editing thte video and includign a few parts that we had missed while making the code and teh script which included the testing and the erros as well as running test cases on the code that we had just prepared. Overall it was a collaborative and productive day.

Friday
Today was the day of our presentation. We the the second group in line so we waited for the first group to finish and took up our place to being the team test. We began by showing teach our video and pausing at a few many point so that he could try out the code that we had come up with and look into how it works. Overall he seems to be impressed by what we had done and gave us a 3.9/4 as our seed for this team test. i also managed to increase my previous seed through the extra credit assignment by a 0.2 which really did help the overall grade. We ended the day by discussing what we were going to do for the next week project.
