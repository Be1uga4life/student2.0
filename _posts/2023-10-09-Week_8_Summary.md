Week 8 Summary

Monday
We started the day by making plans for the video that was due tomorrow. We then continued our work on the figma design for the frontend design for the recipe book manager site for NATM. We worked on the design on figma for a while figuring out how everything work on that site as well as how to extract code from that site into our own sites. We completed our day by planning out what we were going to do the next day.

Tuesday
We started the day by listening in to the Booleans IF lesson and also work on the homework assigned by the team. We then presented our video to teach and continued our added a few finishing touches to it. After that we began grading homework from our Algorithms lesson into a spreadsheet. WE ran into a problem with figma as to how we were going export the code, we realised we couldn't and thus created another design, completely code based into our frontend site.

Wednesday
We continued our work on the frontend design and completed a few bug checks that arose the previous day. WE then completed correcting the homework from last week and sent it to teach. WE then began our work on understanding API and how they work so that we can integrate the backend API into our site and diaply data the way we want it to be after the API was setup. We concluded the day by telling people their scores.

Thursday
We started the day by a student teaching lesson on iteration. I then worked on completing the homework from the student teaching and submitting it to their site. We then continued our work on the API testing site, from the Edamam API, to understand how to fetch data from a backend server and output data into the frontend site by adding in some HTML code to format the data from the backend servers to the frontend the way we wanted it to looks as well as making it look pretty cool.

Friday
We started the day by continuing our work on API testing site and after a quick tech talk from teach we worked our way to compelete the testing blog and make the seach bar work. We ended the day with a quick team meet from next weeks plans.
