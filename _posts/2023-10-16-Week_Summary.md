Week 9 Summary

Monday
We began the day by listening in to a teach talk about API integration and the use of postman to verify API and how they work and if they work. We then continued our work on integrating the backend API to the frontend site and the code of how that works. We then presented our basic commits from last week and our progress throughout the work from the previous weeks. After that we continued working on our codes.

Tuesday
We started the day by listening into a student teaching teach talk about developing algorithms. After the talk we did pretty much nothing on the frontend site but jsut worked on completing their assigned homework and submitting it into the assigned space. After that we continued our work on the code for the frontend.

Wednesday
Today was a work day. After a quick teach talk from teach we continued our work on linking the frontend servers to the backend API, this was a critical and a hard part of the overall project and thus had all of us working on it together trying to come up with a solution together. WE then continued working to develop a code to link from servers.

Thursday
Today was just a student lesson day. The student lesson seemed to talk the whole class period and so we just listened in to the student teaching project and working on completing the homewrok that was assigned.

Friday
Today was just another work day for NATM and since the night at the museum night was closing in and the end of tri was also closing in we continue on figuring out how to link the frontend site to the backend server API, and we seemed to have figured out something in relation o the the working the API using the console on vscode. We then continue developing the code more to integrate it into our websites and concluded the day by reviewing homework and previous submissions.
