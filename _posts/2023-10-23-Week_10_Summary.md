Week 10 Summary

Monday
We began the week by making plans for what each of us were going to do for the frontend site throughout the entirely of the week. We then continued our work for the frontend site, and also developed a new search bar to search for recipes across the 4000+ recipes card that are extracted from the API. We then continued our work on fixing the images bug, which for use we could not figure out a way to display them correctly in the correct recipe card, or even display any image for that sake.

Tuesday
WE began the day with a student lesson about developing procedure, since Monday, Tuesday and Thursday this week was going to be a shorter duration owing to drills, we did our homework for the procedures lesson, and then work on the frontend site. We made a few changes to the frontend site which included the search bar, as well as creating a few more. interesting things to show at NATM.

Wednesday
WE continued our work on the frontend site and since we were going to present our work to teach today we planned out on how we were going to present it. Shark tank was the first think on our minds and thus we went with that itself. As it turns out it worked out well and and we ended up qualifying for NATM as well as bagging a 2 on the overall score.

Thursday
We started the day with a student lesson about Python Libraries. The lesson was pretty cool and interesting to work with. The librares are really useful stuff to work with and on. We continued our work on the frontend site, as there were still a few fixes that we had to attempt espicially with the images tab as our images did'nt seem to display on the committed website. WE tried a few fixes with the code and asked Mr. Lopez for help but none of it seemed to work at all.

Friday
We started the day by planning what each of us was going to do for the day. WE continued our work on the frontend site and tried to make it look cool and better for the viewer. We still tried to fix the error with the images but still could'nt make it work and thus hung the error as unsolved. We planned out what we were going to do over the weekend.
