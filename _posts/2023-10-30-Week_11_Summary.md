Night At the Museum Week Summary

Week 11 was our night at the museum week. WE started the week by completing our code and fixing any bugs pending over, mostly our main bug, the images one. I completed my individual review for my final project and blog with teach. We the rehearsed for the night at the museum. The dress rehearsal the day of NATM was pretty cool as well, we got know way we could improve our code and the different ways to communicate our code to other people

Night at the Museum was a pretty cool experience for all of us. it got off to a rough start as the backend server had broken down, so we had to show our entire project on locahost, but we could'nt figure out how to show our recipe list on local host so we jsut showed the people the backend api url and the api where you'd add in more recipes as well as delete recipes. But overall this was a pretty cool experience for, we learnt a bunch of things, communication being the most important. Overall this was an awesome experience that we hope to do again next trimester.
