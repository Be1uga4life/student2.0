CPT Project
Together with my team, Cayden, Austin, Sri and Saaras we created a project game dashboard which when logged in the user can play a a bunch of games such as crosswords, a spinner, tic tac toe and more.

My feature
I created the facial recognition page, and most of the Backend features such as the endpoint. I also make the system where the JWT was generated and sent to the frontend, and the code for the frontend that would recieve that JWT Token and store it within its local storage. I also contributed and helped saaras setup the leaderboard and the points system for the database.
