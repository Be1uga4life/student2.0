#### Data Structures Write Up


Intro:
- The CPT project includes implementation of algorithms and data structures. Throughout my project I used algorithms and data structures to create a spotify song predictor.

- To complete the CPT we had many tools to use such as vscode, github, and our teachers and teammates to help us create this unique project.

- I use lists, dictionaries, sets, trees, and many more things in my CPT to be able to make the best out of it. Examples may include my data set with the 1100+ houses.

- Overall, the CPT project helps us align our computer science skills and apply them all together with the abilities and knowledge of others to create something with true meaning and effort.

- The data structures project helped me learn integrate various projects into one. It helped me collaborate and fix errors with my team and improve my features, overall giving me a good experience throughout this trimester.



This is the machine learning form for the song suggestor.

This is the table that contains all the users that are allowed to login in the spotify application, their password is contained as a hashed password.

Requirement #2: From VSCode model, show your unique code that was created to initialize table and create test data.
